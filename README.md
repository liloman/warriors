# Warriors

My timewarrior taskwarrior integration scripts 

##Taskwarrior 

1. Hook on-modify.timewarrior to track every task with timewarrior properly
2. ptask.sh to create some task as for example reminders (temporal,fixed or recurrent) that are shown on pomodoroTask2 too. :)

##Timewarrior

1. Two new reports for timewarrior
timew total :today
and 
timew work :today
To track total time of the projects

2. lastboots.sh
Let you track the last or all your previous boots with timewarrior so you track all the lifespan of your computer


##Install 

Just copy the hook/reports to  ~.task/hook or ~.timewarrior/extensions and enjoin the new reports or hooks.

##TODO

- [ ] Script to move all the old tasks to timewarrior to track them all and be able to report them! ;)
